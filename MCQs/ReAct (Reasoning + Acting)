D) Self-Consistency
5.ReAct differs from Chain-of-Thoughtecause it:

6.In an AI assistant that can “think, search, and respond,” which part demonstrates ReAct?
A) Storing answers in memory
B) Searching the web mid-reasoning
C) Generating random jokes
D) Reducing token length
7.What is the biggest advantage of ReAct over plain CoT?
A) Faster token generation
B) Ability to use tools and external sources dynamically

8.When implementing ReAct, what risk can occur if the model acts before reasoning?
A) Action may be irrelevant or wasteful
B) Model runs faster
C) Output becomes shorter
D) Improves reasoning quality automatically
9.Which of the following is not an example of a ReAct action?

B) Performing a calculation
C) Explaining a step logically
D) Searching an API
10.Why is ReAct valuable for AI agents in real-world scenarios?
A) It limits actions
B) It enables autonomous problem-solving through reasoning–action loops
C) It avoids using memory
D) It reduces context window
11.Example:“Let me fetch the latest weather data.” (Action)

C) Ignoring the issue
D) Repeating the same explanation
14.Which statement best captures ReAct’s design?
A) “Think → Do → Think → Do”

B) The model reading the result of its last action
C) The model waiting for user input
D) A random process
17.A model says:“I’ll calculate the sum of the list.” (action)
